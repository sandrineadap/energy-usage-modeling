# Energy Usage Modeling for Data-Driven Decisions

Electricity bills are determined based on your price plan. For example, in Oshawa, Ontario, you can choose between Time-of-Use (TOU), Tiered, and Ultra-Low Overnight (ULO) pricing plans.
But how do we know which pricing plan best suits our needs?

In this project, I used R to determine the most cost-effective pricing plan by analyzing electricity consumption data and presenting it in a way that makes it easy for property owners to make an informed decision. To do so, I:

1. Aggregated and prepped 3 years of electricity consumption data from CSV files.
2. Created interactive graphs for daily and monthly usage so the owners could easily identify when their usage spiked or dropped and what caused it.

This gave the owners insight into what pricing plan would work best for them and what daily lifestyle choices could help lower their energy bills.
